## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Instead of one image being provided and trying to resize for responsive viewing, two different sizes of the same image were provided for use between desktop and mobile view. I had to look up a suggestion on how to do it, but using the **display** property was my best shot, after inserting both images into the HTML markup.
