## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Two different sizes of the same image were provided for use between desktop and mobile view. When I first tackled this, I thought toggling the `display` property with a `@media` breakpoint was my best shot, after inserting both images into the HTML markup.

Thanks to some feedback from [@coffeeslammer](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/coffeeslammer) on Frontend Mentor, I used the tip about the HTML `<picture>` tag instead for my later revision.
